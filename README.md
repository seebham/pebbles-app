<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

  The dictionary meaning of "pebbles" is 'small rounded stones' but, here pebbles means stones of all sizes which represents different tasks/duties/assignments and hobbies, that we want to fit in and plan in our daily routine. 'Pebbles' app is made for implementing the Time Management Matrix technique proposed by Dr Stephen Covey in any a most efficent and convenient way possible.
  The name 'pebble' came into my mind from the famous represetation of Time management using Stones, pebbles and sand. 
  
  Below are the videos for understanding both the concepts.

Here's why I developed this app:
* I read "The 7 habits of Highly Effective People" by Stephen Covey, which gave this Time Management Matrix technique to plan our weeks and I wanted to inculcate it in my routine
* At first I tried sketching it on a notebook but it was not that appealing and convenient for me
* And in this new normal, checking our smartphone is the first thing we do in the morning. Thus, I decided to give it try and tried developing this app! :smile:

Of course, there many more features need to be added. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
